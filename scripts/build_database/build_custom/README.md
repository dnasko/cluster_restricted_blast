# Creating your own RUBBLE BLAST database

I've written a little BASH wrapper script that will created a RUBBLE BLAST database using CD-HIT.
If you do not have CD-HIT installed it won't work. [Find CD-HIT here](http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/ "CD-HIT").

To run, simply issue:

`./build_custom_rubble_database.sh input.fasta`
